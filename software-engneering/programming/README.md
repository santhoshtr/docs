Some of my favorite from the above Epigrams by Alan J. Perlis

* Optimization hinders evolution.
* One man's constant is another man's variable.
* A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.
*  Symmetry is a complexity reducing concept \(co-routines include sub-routines\); seek it everywhere.
*  It is easier to write an incorrect program than understand a correct one.
* When we write programs that "learn", it turns out we do and they don't.
* Within a computer natural language is unnatural.
