# People

* [**Alan Turing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan\_Turing) - developed [theoretical computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theoretical\_computer\_science), providing a formalisation of the concepts of [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) and [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation) with the [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing\_machine), which can be considered a model of a [general-purpose computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose\_computer). Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\_intelligence).
  * In 2013,[ I wrote a Malayalam article](https://thottingal.in/documents/turing/) about him and his contributions&#x20;
* [**Fabrice Bellard**](https://bellard.org): known for creating [FFmpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg), [QEMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU), and [Tiny C Compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny\_C\_Compiler) software projects. He developed [Bellard's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellard's\_formula) for calculating single digits of [pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi).
  * [Fabrice Bellard: Portrait of a Super-Productive Programmer](https://smartbear.com/blog/test-and-monitor/fabrice-bellard-portrait-of-a-super-productive-pro/)(2011)
  * [English wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrice\_Bellard)
  * [A small C program to print the biggest prime number](https://bellard.org/mersenne.html)
  * [ACM Journal Article](https://web.archive.org/web/20110726063943/http://www.freearchive.org/o/55dfc9935a719fc36ab1d16567972732c2db1fd7d7e3826fd73ee07e4c3c7d0b)
* [**Kurt Gödel**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt\_G%C3%B6del) **-** Theoretical foundations on computability. Gödel published his two [incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's\_incompleteness\_theorems) in 1931 when he was 25 years old, one year after finishing his doctorate at the [University of Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University\_of\_Vienna). The first incompleteness theorem states that for any self-consistent [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive\_set) [axiomatic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic\_system) powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the [natural numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural\_number) (for example [Peano arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano\_arithmetic)), there are true propositions about the natural numbers that cannot be proved from the [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axioms). To prove this theorem, Gödel developed a technique now known as [Gödel numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del\_numbering), which codes formal expressions as natural numbers.

  * [Kurt Gödel’s Brilliant Madness](https://www.cantorsparadise.com/kurt-g%C3%B6dels-brilliant-madness-84288dd96eda)
* [**John von Neumann**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John\_von\_Neumann) **-** Von Neumann made major contributions to many fields, including [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) ([foundations of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations\_of\_mathematics), [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional\_analysis), [ergodic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic\_theory), [representation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation\_theory), [operator algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator\_algebras), [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry), [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology), and [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical\_analysis)), [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) ([quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_mechanics), [hydrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid\_dynamics), and [quantum statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_statistical\_mechanics)), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) ([game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game\_theory)), [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) ([Von Neumann architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von\_Neumann\_architecture), [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear\_programming), [self-replicating machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von\_Neumann\_universal\_constructor), [stochastic computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic\_computing)), and [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics).
  * He was a pioneer of the application of [operator theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator\_theory) to quantum mechanics in the development of functional analysis, and a key figure in the development of [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game\_theory) and the concepts of [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular\_automaton), the [universal constructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von\_Neumann\_universal\_constructor) and the [digital computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer).
