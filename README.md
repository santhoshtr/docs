# Welcome

Hi  there 👋 

This is my personal knowledge space where I try to document and share everything I know about this world in form of an [online GitBook](https://docs.thottingal.in/) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/santhoshtr/docs).  I also write blog posts in[ my blog](https://thottingal.in/blog) occassionally, but eventually I organize the content here and try to keep it updated.

My native language is Malayalam. So you will see good amount of content in this space written in Malayalam.

**But who am I? If you are curious, please read this brief self introduction:**

## Digital garden 🌱 <a id="grow-your-own-digital-garden"></a>

In basic terms, it is a different format for written content on the web. It’s about moving away from blog posts ordered by dates and categories, into more of an interlinked web of notes. Blog posts are articles at a point in time, while here it is living document. [Digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) are also known as [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) or Second Brain.

I got inspiration from [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) to start this space. There is a [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/). Nikita Voloboev  has a list of [such wikis](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/other/wiki-workflow#similar-wikis-i-liked).

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.

## Using content from this site

Feel free to use content from this site. I would be happy to see the source acknowledged, but won't sue you for not doing it 🙂 .

There is no permananent links in this site, except the domain. Since this is a living document, I rearrange the content very often.

## Contributing <a id="contributing"></a>

If you found a mistake anywhere, I would appreciate your help. GitBook provides a quick way to open GitHub page for any entry so you can make changes and submit a PR.

I'd love to hear any [ideas you have](https://github.com/santhoshtr/docs/issues) on how I can improve this wiki.
