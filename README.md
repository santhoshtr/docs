# Welcome

Hi  there :wave:&#x20;

This is my personal knowledge space where I try to document and share everything I know about this world in form of an [online GitBook](https://docs.thottingal.in/) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/santhoshtr/docs).  I also write blog posts in[ my blog](https://thottingal.in/blog) occassionally, but eventually I organize the content here and try to keep it updated.

My native language is Malayalam. So you will see good amount of content in this space written in Malayalam.

**But who am I? If you are curious, please read this brief self introduction:**

## Digital garden ðŸŒ± <a href="#grow-your-own-digital-garden" id="grow-your-own-digital-garden"></a>

In basic terms, it is a different format for written content on the web. Itâ€™s about moving away from blog posts ordered by dates and categories, into more of an interlinked web of notes. Blog posts are articles at a point in time, while here it is living document. [Digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) are also known as [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) or Second Brain.

I got inspiration from [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) to start this space. There is a [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).&#x20;

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.
