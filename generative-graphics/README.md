# Generative Graphics

[English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative\_art) says : **Generative art** refers to [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art) that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the [generative system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative\_systems) represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.

"Generative art" often refers to [algorithmic art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic\_art) (algorithmically determined computer generated artwork) and [synthetic media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic\_media) (general term for any algorithmically-generated media), but artists can also make it using systems of [chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology), [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics) and [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics), [smart materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart\_materials), manual [randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomization), [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics), [data mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\_mapping), [symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry), [tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation), and more.
