> "If we aim to match the performance of ChatGPT through open source, I believe we need to start taking training data more seriously. A substantial part of ChatGPT’s effectiveness might not come from, say, specific ML architecture, fine-tuning techniques, or frameworks. But more likely, it’s from the breadth, scale and quality of the instruction data.

> To put it bluntly, fine-tuning large language models on mediocre instruction data is a waste of compute. Let’s take a look at what has changed in the training data and learning paradigm—how we are now formatting the training data differently and therefore learning differently than in past large-scale pre-training."

* https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/generative-ais-end-run-around-copyright We don’t think the injustice at the heart of generative AI will be redressed by the courts. Maybe changes to copyright law are necessary. Or maybe it will take other kinds of policy interventions that are outside the scope of copyright law. Either way, policymakers can’t take the easy way out.
