* [Codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) - For sharing code samples that require framework support like Vue projects. An easy way to import a repo to CodeSandbox via URL is with GitHubBox.com. Append 'box' to your github.com URL in between 'hub' and '.com' and it will redirect to CodeSandbox. Here's an example:

  Change the GitHub URL: [https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc).

  To: [https://githubbox.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc](https://githubbox.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc)
