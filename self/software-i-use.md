# Software I use

## Operating system

* Ubuntu latest releases with KDE as desktop in my Lenovo X1 Carbon laptop.
* Android 11 in my Redmi note 10 phone

## Editors

* [VS Code ](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/text-editors/vs-code) - Primary IDE for software development. 
  * [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as monospace font with programming ligatures enabled.
* [Kate](https://kate-editor.org) - For quick text editing. KDE's text editor
* nano - for editing in console. Also Git commit message editor
* Libreoffice - For all ODT, Presentation, Word documents

### Online editors

*   [Codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) - For sharing code samples that require framework support like Vue projects. An easy way to import a repo to CodeSandbox via URL is with GitHubBox.com. Append 'box' to your github.com URL in between 'hub' and '.com' and it will redirect to CodeSandbox. Here's an example:

    Change the GitHub URL: [https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc).

    To: [https://githubbox.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc](https://githubbox.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc)
* [codepen.io](https://codepen.io) - For quick code snippets and illustrations
* Google doc - for collaborative document editing. Heavily used at work
* [https://etherpad.org/](https://etherpad.org) for quick collaborative notes. Mostly etherpad.wikimedia.org instance

## Browser

* I use Firefox as primary browser.
* Chrome for my WMF account. Also for its powerful developer tools. 

## Shell

* [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) with [https://ohmyz.sh/](https://ohmyz.sh) plugins. I use [Yakuake](https://apps.kde.org/en/yakuake) dropdown terminal in KDE. 

## Design

* Inkscape - for all kind of vector drawing, typeface design
* Kolorpaint - for quick Image editing
* Gimp - For image manipulation like resizing , scaling

### Typeface design and development

* Inkscape for design
* [Fontforge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/) for inspecting fonts
* Trufont for quick corrections like bearing, positioning.
* VS Code for opentype engineering wit[h VS code AFDKO extension that I wrote](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=santhoshthottingal.vscode-afdko\&ssr=false). Automation require python programming, shellscripting and Makefile. I use VSCode for all of these.

* [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)  - for illustration concepts, flow charts and so on
* [Kami](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kami-pdf-and-document-ann/iljojpiodmlhoehoecppliohmplbgeij) for PDF annoations, especially for type speciman reviews. Integrates with Google drive

* [Gummi](https://gummi.app) - for simple TeX editor with live preview
* Scribus - rarely. Only for Malayalam support experiments

## Reading

I own a Kindle Paperwhite 10th gen ebook reader.  I like its darkmode. I use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com) for ebook management. 

I use the Reader View in Firefox to get clean reading for many websites including wikipedia.

For my wikipedia based learning, I use my own Wikipedia reader application - [wikipedia.thottingal.in](https://wikipedia.thottingal.in) as PWA(installed in computer and mobile)

#### RSS

For newsfeeds and RSS subscriptions, I use a telegram bot [https://github.com/santhoshtr/telegram-rss-reader](https://github.com/santhoshtr/telegram-rss-reader) It fetches the feeds in regular intervals. Helps me to read in mobile and deskop without any extra application. Adding new feeds is just a matter of pasting the URL to chat. Cons: It is just a linear list of chat messages(I mute it) and don't expect feed categorization and organization as you would expect in a RSS reader application

## Movies

* Netflix
* Amazon Prime
* Youtube(free account).
* VLC  - Not much these days as I use online services.

## Search

I primarily use [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com) as my search engine. Occassionally switch to google if I am curious to see google specific results

## Social media and Chat

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/santhoshtr/) - I use tweetdeck client in desktop
* Facebook - I don't use mobile app or login from mobile. In laptop I access it using [Firefox Facebook container](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/facebookcontainer/). Now a days I check facebook in 10 mins or so maximum per day. Often ends up with various Malayalam computing related questions people ask in its chat.
* Telegram - regularly use for family and friends. Also several foss community channels
* Whatsapp - Not active in any group, but this is required for people to reach out me quickly including some immediate family members.
* slack - All my Wikimedia foundation work related communication

## Blog and Notes

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for [blog](https://thottingal.in/blog)
* [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com) spaces for private notes and this knowledge space. My todo list is also with gitbook

## Password management

I use [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org) for password management with GPG encrypted passwords synced with a private gitlab repo. I use its browser extensions too.

## Digital wellbeing

I use no-distraction mode in Android always. From 9AM to 5PM, I set focus mode in android - it disables many apps in the phone. At night I use the [bedtime mode in Android](https://android.gadgethacks.com/how-to/enable-bedtime-mode-your-android-device-0292856/), which makes the screen black and white, and disables all notification till earliest alarm set.

In desktop I use night time color setting to warm up the screen color at sunset. I use the same setting at phone. Avoiding [blue light](https://www.cpap.com/blog/blue-light-and-sleep/) exposure after sunset [improves sleep quality](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/block-blue-light-to-sleep-better#effects-of-blue-light).

## Internet

I use [wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com) VPN and a [pihole](https://pi-hole.net) in a small VM hosted in oracle cloud. 

I Use [nextdns](https://nextdns.io/?from=5nv2xqe3) for DNS in my router

I also use a VPS by [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=OMKwKIQwjf6B) to host my web applications(that is a referral link worth  â‚¬20)
