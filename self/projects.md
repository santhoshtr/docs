# Projects

## Swanalekha

[Swanalekha transliteration based input method](https://swanalekha.smc.org.in/). Started in [2007](https://thottingal.in/blog/2007/06/18/scim-malayalam-phonetic-input-method-with-lookup-table/), written for my own use, became a widely used input method for Malayalam. Eventhough the same input method was developed for many other Indian languages too, they were abandoned because I failed to get co-developers from those languages to verify and test. 

Initially Swanalekha was writtin using SCIM input method technology for Linux. Later, a javascript version was also developed to use in browsers. By 2019, the input method was ported to SIL Keyman so that it works in non-Linux operating systems too. The Indic Keyboard by SMC also include this input method to support Android phones. In Linux, the input method is currently using m17n framework.
