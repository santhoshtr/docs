# Projects

## Swanalekha

[Swanalekha transliteration based input method](https://swanalekha.smc.org.in/). Started in [2007](https://thottingal.in/blog/2007/06/18/scim-malayalam-phonetic-input-method-with-lookup-table/), written for my own use, became a widely used input method for Malayalam. Eventhough the same input method was developed for many other Indian languages too, they were abandoned because I failed to get co-developers from those languages to verify and test. 

Initially Swanalekha was writtin using SCIM input method technology for Linux. Later, a javascript version was also developed to use in browsers. By 2019, the input method was ported to SIL Keyman so that it works in non-Linux operating systems too. The Indic Keyboard by SMC also include this input method to support Android phones. In Linux, the input method is currently using m17n framework.

## Malayalam Morphology Analyser

An ambitious effort to encode Malayalam morphology in computer algorithms. This is an ongoing and long project with multiple sub projects. I [started this in 2017](https://thottingal.in/blog/2017/11/26/towards-a-malayalam-morphology-analyser/) and continous to actively develop it.

## Tesseract based OCR web frontend

Hosted at [https://ocr.smc.org.in/](https://ocr.smc.org.in/), this is a web frontend for Tesseract.js OCR

## Handwriting recognition

Online handwriting recognition system based on procustes analysis. Available at [https://handwriting.smc.org.in/](https://handwriting.smc.org.in/). The project is incomplete as more letters need to be support and many optimizations are pending. I visit this project occassionally and make some improvement and then move to other projects. Looking for active contributors
