I lead various language computing projects at [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing.](http://smc.org.in) Many of my works on Malayalam computing enable millions of Malayalam users on their computers or phones. I maintain a number of free software projects related to Indic language computing too.

I have done significant contributions to [Malayalam digital typography.](../malayalam-computing/fonts/) I have designed two popular Malayalam typefaces named Chilanka and Manjari. Also maintains a number of other Malayalam unicode fonts. You can see all of these fonts in [SMC website](https://smc.org.in/fonts/). I also have [an article in Malayalam Wikipedia](https://ml.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B4%B8%E0%B4%A8%E0%B5%8D%E0%B4%A4%E0%B5%8B%E0%B4%B7%E0%B5%8D_%E0%B4%A4%E0%B5%8B%E0%B4%9F%E0%B5%8D%E0%B4%9F%E0%B4%BF%E0%B4%99%E0%B5%8D%E0%B4%99%E0%B5%BD)

## Profession

### Wikimedia Foundation

Currently I am working as Principal Software Engineer at Language Engineering team of [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org). I work on MediaWiki language support, internationalization, localization, input methods for large number of languages in which Wikipedia exist, fonts, translation tools etc. I live at Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. I work remotely. I joined Wikimedia Foundation in 2011 September 1st.

### Infosys

From 2015 July 10 to July 2011, I worked at [Infosys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosys). This was my first job after graduating from engineering college. I mainly worked on [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29), [J2EE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_EE) based projects at Infosys for clients like [Airbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus), [Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing)\(for Boeing Dreamliner\), [General Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors), [Toyota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota) and [Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments). When I was resigning, I was working in technology architecture group as junior architect. 

My role was mostly technology troubleshooting and helping senior architects. In the last 2 years at Infosys, I had a rather interesting role as extreme programmer where I was sent to various campuses to help engineering who are miserably failing to deliver on time. I was expected to replace a few engineers, learn the project in a day or two, finish the project as fast as possible. If you think that I need to work weekends and nights for this, you are mistaken :-\). I worked only 8 hours and only 5 days per week in this role. I visited Pune, Bangalore, Chennai offices for this kind of adventures.  I was also part of technical interview teams.

Another interesting project I worked there was for [Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments). They wanted a single person with special project budget to work on experimental projects that are technically complex and time sensitive. I helped them to build their electronic component datasheet indexing and searching project using Apache Lucene and Solr.

For a short duration in 2010, I worked for [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.). This was another assignment to help a team missing their deadlines to deliver. I visited Bangalore campus for three months. For that short period of time, I owned the email santhosh at apple.com :-\) 

## Education

I studied in state public schools near my village at Palakkad. After 10th standard, I went to [MES Kalladi College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MES_Kalladi_College), Mannarkkad for Pre-Degree. I did my Engineering\(Computer Science\) at [NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSS_College_of_Engineering) under [University of Calicut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Calicut). Since I was from an economically backward family, I never had to pay education fee, even for my Engineering degree, thanks to [Kerala goverments scheme to support students](http://bcdd.kerala.gov.in/schemes/educational-schemes/educational-assistance-under-kpcr/).
