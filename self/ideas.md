# Ideas

* Create an education font showing how to write a letter using arrows and dots to represent pen movement. This could be possible from Chilanka or Manjari since the SVGs I used has directions in it. Try programmatical approach
* A slow news portal - News are collected, reconciled and presented once the dust settles, with clarity, with out knee jerk reactions. For most of the people, reading news after 2 days makes many things clear and saves anxiety and helps to understand the world better avoiding sensationalim, click baits and yellow news. Also see [Slow Journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_journalism)
* A regular online webinar on Malayalam computing where people working on different aspects presents their ideas, projects and discuss it with audience. Make it informal conversations, record, publish
*
