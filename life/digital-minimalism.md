# Digital Minimalism

> **Digital minimalism** is a philosophy that helps you question what digital communication tools \(and behaviors surrounding these tools\) add the most value to your life. It is motivated by the belief that intentionally and aggressively clearing away low-value digital noise, and optimizing your use of the tools that really matter, can significantly improve your life.
