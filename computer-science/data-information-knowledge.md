# Data, Information, Knowledge

**Information** forms when data is combined and put into a context. 

**Knowledge** is something that forms in my head, but can't be extracted or stored. All I can do is to talk and write and hope that the stream of words I produce conveys enough information so the same knowledge forms in other peoples heads.
